# ExaJuGO: Exascale Julia Grid Optimization

Simple Julia scrips for solving AC power flow, AC optimal power flow, and
security-constrained AC optimal power flow.

These scripts are intended for experimentation with different (possibly, new)
methods, formulations, and settings for solving these power system problem.
Their implementation, therefore, intentionally avoids excessive encapsulation,
which makes other packages difficult to modify by non-developers.

## Installation

The implementation requires *Julia* 1+. After clonning, issue (from a terminal):

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ julia -e "using Pkg; Pkg.activate(\".\"); Pkg.instantiate()"
```

from the repository directory to install all dependencies (submodules, Julia
packages, and Ipopt binaries).

## Usage

### Power flow

To solve AC power flow, issue:

```
$ julia /path/to/ACPF.jl /path/to/raw/file.raw /path/to/solution/folder
```

For example, from the repository folder, issuing:

```
$ julia ACPF.jl ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.raw ./example_acpf_solution
```

would solve the power flow problem for the 500-bus system in the `examples/500bus_example_data`
directory.

### Optimal power flow

To solve AC optimal power flow, issue:

```
$ julia /path/to/ACOPF.jl  /path/to/raw/file.raw /path/to/raw/file.rop /path/to/solution/folder
```

For example, from the repository folder, issuing:

```
$ julia ACOPF.jl ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.raw  ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.rop ./example_acopf_solution
```

would solve the optimal power flow problem for the 500-bus system in the
`examples/500bus_example_data` directory.

Alternatively, you may specify just the directory where `case.raw` and 
`case.rop` files are located, i.e.,

```
$ julia ACOPF.jl ./examples/500bus_example_data ./example_acopf_solution
```

which, in this case, would produce the same result as the command above.

### Security-constrained optimal power flow

To solve security-constrained AC optimal power flow, issue:

```
$ julia /path/to/ACOPF.jl  /path/to/raw/file.raw /path/to/raw/file.rop /path/to/raw/file.con 
/path/to/solution/folder
```

For example, from the repository folder, issuing:

```
$ julia SCACOPF.jl ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.raw  ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.rop ./examples/500bus_example_data/case.con ./example_scacopf_solution
```

would solve the optimal power flow problem for the 500-bus system in the
`examples/500bus_example_data` directory.

Alternatively, you may specify just the directory where `case.raw`, `case.rop` and
`case.con` files are located, i.e.,

```
$ julia ACOPF.jl ./examples/500bus_example_data ./example_scacopf_solution
```

which, in this case, would produce the same result as the command above.
